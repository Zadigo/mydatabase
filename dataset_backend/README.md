Slides -> Page -> Blocks


## Data source

A data source (model `DataSource`) represents either local CSV source from an uploaded file, a local CSV source loaded from an API endpoint or a Google Sheet connection. A data source is simply the underlying data used to show display tables and graphs in the frontend.


## Slide

A slide is a page used to show different blocks such as tables, graphs [...] using a data source.

## Blocks

A block is a section that contains for example a single table or a graph to display data either from the slide if the main data source is the slide or data from the block itself if the block is linked to a data source.
