# Frontend Application

Created with Nuxt 4, this application provides the main interface for helping users create their databases
with a user-friendly design and powerful features.

## Structure

The Google/Excel sheets are organised under databases. A database is a collection of related 
data entries that can be easily managed and manipulated. 

Each database can contain multiple tables, and each table can have its own set of fields and records.
A table is just a different name for Google/Excel sheets.

### tables

There are three sorts of tables in a database:

* __Data Table__: This is where the actual data is stored. Each row represents a single record, and each column represents a field within that record.
* __Graph Table__: This table is used to store data in a graph format, allowing for more complex relationships between records.
